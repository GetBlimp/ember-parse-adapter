Currently in a very alpha state. \r\n\r\nAt the moment this performs only the simple CRUD features. However the implementation \r\ndoes drop the core of the Parse JavaScript SDK.\r\n\r\nThis is a CORS implementation. It has nuances. As an example Parse REST API only responds\r\nto SSL requests. Due to IE8+ CORS implementations that means you must run your app under SSL. As well\r\nsome browsers will perform an OPTIONS call along-side the regular GET/PUT/POST/DELETE \r\n(still investigating all of this - and learning). I chose to re-use the Parse XDomainRequest implementation\r\nand then use jQuery for all other supporting browsers. This might be a dead-end and I might\r\nbe wiser to use Parse's full XHR implementation (it's small and smart - but I'm trying to be original).\r\n\r\nThe branch currently works with the Ember versions listed in the example.html AS-IS. \r\nThe example is using the master branch of Ember and Ember-Data (built for this project). \r\nThere is also 1 modification done here locally to flip a guard for Ember.BOOTED inside \r\nember-latest.js (line: 5495). I apologize for this kind of kludgery. I dislike it myself. \r\nBut understand this is temporary and you really shouldn't be using this project yet anyways. \r\nIn fact you should be forking and fixing. Thanks!\r\n\r\nFeatures\r\n--------\r\n\r\n* ParseConnector: Ember Mixin\r\n  * Provides the AJAX connectivity to the Parse REST API.\r\n* ParseJSONSerializer: Ember Data JSONSerializer\r\n  * Provides the translation of objectId to id.\r\n* ParseJSONTransforms: Ember Data JSONTranforms\r\n  * Provides Date transforms for ISO Dates in Parse.\r\n* ParseAdapter: Ember Data Adapter\r\n  * Implements the minimum required Adapter CRUD functionality.\r\n* ParseMixin: Ember Mixin\r\n  * Provides created/updated date attributes.\r\n\r\nIssues\r\n------\r\n\r\n* Incomplete example.\r\n* Demo is rough due to Parse acct dependency.\r\n\r\nRoadmap\r\n-------\r\n\r\n* Implement findQuery.\r\n* Implement findMany.\r\n* Implement Store recordWasError et al in error conditions.\r\n* Implement full type encodings supported by Parse.\r\n* Expose more Parse info inside the ParseMixin.\r\n\r\nDev Notes\r\n---------\r\n* To get a build simply grunt. You'll find builds inside the /dist folder.\r\n* Tagging is formatted as 'vX.X.X' v.X.X.X\r\n","google":"","tagline":"An Ember.js Data Adapter for Parse"}
